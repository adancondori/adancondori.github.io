Hello! My name is Adan Condori and I am a Software Engineer with more than 8 years of experience in Web and Mobile Software Development, Software Architecture Design and Project Leadership. I have worked with high performance cloud servers such as AWS, AZURE and IBM, as well as having done integrations with other systems and integrations with payment gateways and Infrastructure applications such as Code, always focused on solving customer problems and understanding the business process and customers.

I have led more than 5 development teams in the technology area, which has allowed me to work on a wide range of projects, from the creation of custom software to integration with other systems. All these projects have been carried out with programming standards accompanied by working methodologies to ensure the quality of the software.

I am also passionate about traveling, getting to know new cultures, reading and learning. If you want to contact me, write me to the email: adancondoric@gmail.com.

Well, I am a responsible person, committed and focused on my family and my work. I give 100% and I put my shirt on every project, always looking for the right remuneration. In my free time, I like to share knowledge as a teacher in some universities in Bolivia.
