I am looking for postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to
work on a new project using machine learning to model the performance
of parallel applications, with a focus on data-dependent and adaptive
algorithms.

This job is part of a much larger set of efforts at LLNL on
performance analysis, tools, debugging, modeling, visualization, and
other aspects of HPC.
