### Short Bio

Todd is a computer scientist in the [Center for Applied Scientific
Computing](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) at [Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory](http://www.llnl.gov). His research focuses on
scalable tools for measuring, analyzing, and visualizing performance
data from massively parallel applications.  Todd is also involved with
many production projects at LLNL.  He works with [Livermore
Computing](http://computing.llnl.gov/)'s Development Environment Group
to build tools that allow users to deploy, run, debug, and optimize
their software for machines with million-way concurrency.

Todd received his Ph.D. in computer science from the [University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://cs.unc.edu) in 2009.  His
dissertation investigated parallel methods for compressing and
sampling performance measurements from hundreds of thousands of
concurrent processors. He received his B.A. in Computer Science and
Japanese from [Williams College](http://www.williams.edu) in 2002. He
has also worked as a software developer in Tokyo and held research
internships at the [University of
