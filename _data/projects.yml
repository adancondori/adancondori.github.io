    Cram runs many small MPI jobs within a single, large MPI job by
    virtualizing its MPI operations. Cram has been used to run 1.5
    million concurrent MPI jobs on LLNL's
    [Sequoia](http://computation.llnl.gov/computers/sequoia) machine.

    Rubik generates MPI task mapping files for structured applications
    and torus or mesh networks.  It applies transforamtions to an
    application topology to generate the mappings.

    Parallel K-medoids clustering library, used in performance and
    debugging tools. Implements PAM, CLARA, the
    [CAPEK](http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~tgamblin/pubs/scalable-cluster-ics10.pdf)
    parallel clustering algorithm, and an MPI-parallel Bayesian
    Information Criterion (BIC) calculation.
