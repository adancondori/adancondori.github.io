I am a computer scientist in the [Center for Applied Scientific
Computing](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/) at [Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov).  My research focuses on
scalable tools and algorithms for measuring, analyzing, visualizing,
and understanding the massively parallel simulations that run on
supercomputers.
